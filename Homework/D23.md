# D23: Implement TinyYolov3 on Raspberry Pi
This task is exactly the same as D22, the only difference is the change in model. In which it is changed to the tiny version of YOLO
## Homework1: The difference between YOLOv3 and TinyYolo
Ans: They model size and parameters and training time differ, while we still need to adjust the training classes and filter numbers.
## Homework2: Change the class numbers to 7.
The filter size is relevant to the bounding boxes to each cell. Hence the equation to calculate filters is as follows:

**Bx(5+C)**

B is the number of bounding boxes a cell on the feature map can predict, “5” is for the 4 bounding box attributes and one object confidence, and C is the number of classes

Hence, the original filter size is 1x1x255
