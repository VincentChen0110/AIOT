# D21: Imply Google Colab with YOLOv3
In this homework, the classification images and the model is prepared for us already.
## 1. Since there are only three classes to classify, change classes from 5 to 3 and the filter number from 30 to 24
```python
!cp cfg/yolov3.cfg cfg/yolov3_training.cfg
!sed -i 's/batch=1/batch=64/' cfg/yolov3_training.cfg
!sed -i 's/subdivisions=1/subdivisions=16/' cfg/yolov3_training.cfg
!sed -i 's/max_batches = 500200/max_batches = 4000/' cfg/yolov3_training.cfg
!sed -i '610 s@classes=80@classes=3@' cfg/yolov3_training.cfg
!sed -i '696 s@classes=80@classes=3@' cfg/yolov3_training.cfg
!sed -i '783 s@classes=80@classes=3@' cfg/yolov3_training.cfg
!sed -i '603 s@filters=255@filters=24@' cfg/yolov3_training.cfg
!sed -i '689 s@filters=255@filters=24@' cfg/yolov3_training.cfg
!sed -i '776 s@filters=255@filters=24@' cfg/yolov3_training.cfg
```
## 2. **SED** is the stream editor in UNIX commands
-i is to to insertion to the text, changing the original file
## 3. **echo** one of the most commonly and widely used built-in command for Linux bash and C shells. 
Typically used in scripting language and batch files to display a line of text/string on standard output or a file.
The ‘-e‘ option in Linux acts as interpretation of escaped characters that are backslashed.
      
      For example: \b :between spaces, \n: between lines
## 4. Use colab to create a shell script using echo
commands in the shell script:
```linux
touch bash.sh 
echo -e "2021 is coming" > bash.sh 
bash bash.sh
```
echo command
```linux
echo -e "touch bash.sh\necho -e "2021 is coming" > bash.sh\nbash bash.sh" 
```
