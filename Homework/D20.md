# Object Detection with YOLO
## What is Object Detection?
Ans: Given an input image and return the name of the object inside the image.
## What is YOLO(You only look once)?
Ans: YOLO is a convolutional neural network (CNN) for doing object detection in real-time. 
The algorithm applies a single neural network to the full image, and then divides the image into regions and predicts bounding boxes and probabilities for each region. 
These bounding boxes are weighted by the predicted probabilities.
## Network architecture: 
Ans : It's base model is derived from InceptionNet, with the inception layers being replaced.
